# WineQualityPredictor_LinearRegression
Red Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties. We use Gradient Descent to find the optimal weights (training) instead of relying on pre-built libraries.
